# 📦 Merge Sort C++ Implementation

This repository contains a **professional-grade** implementation of the **Merge Sort** algorithm in C++, designed to handle both integers and strings input by the user. 🧠🚀

## 📁 File Overview

```
├── merge_sort.cpp   # Full merge sort implementation (generic + input handling)
├── README.md        # You're reading it
```

---

## ✨ Features

* ✅ **Generic implementation** using C++ templates
* 🔁 **Stable sorting** (preserves order of equal elements)
* 📥 Accepts user input for both numbers and words
* 📤 Displays sorted output clearly
* 🧪 Suitable for academic, learning, or production experimentation

## 🧠 Algorithm Summary

**Merge Sort** is a classic `divide and conquer` sorting technique:

1. 🔪 **Divide**: Recursively split the array into two halves.
2. 📦 **Conquer**: Sort each half.
3. 🧩 **Merge**: Merge the sorted halves into one sorted array.

**Characteristics:**

* Time Complexity: **O(n log n)** for best, average, and worst cases
* Space Complexity: **O(n)** (uses temporary vector)
* Sorting Type: **Stable**
* Best For: **Large datasets, linked lists, external sorting**

## ⚙️ How to Compile

Using `g++` on the terminal:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 merge_sort.cpp -o merge_sort
```

---

## 🧪 Sample Usage

### ▶️ Example Input:

```
Enter number of integers to sort: 6
Enter 6 integers:
10 2 34 7 1 0
Enter number of words to sort: 4
Enter 4 words:
banana apple cherry date
```

### ✅ Output:

```
Sorted integers:
0 1 2 7 10 34
Sorted words:
apple banana cherry date
```
